## Introduction to Vector Databases
Vector databases are optimized to store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors in linear algebra. A scalar is a real number. It has just magnitude. A vector is an element in vector space which has both magnitude and direction. In linear algebra, vectors are represented as finite and ordered lists of one or more scalars with direction. In computer programming, a vector is represented as a one-dimensional array of numbers with fixed length. A vector with N dimensions will be represented as a one-dimensional array with N elements in it.

So how are vectors generated in machine learning and artificial intelligence? 

### Vector Generation

A vector is generated by applying a mathematical transformation, a machine learning model, or an embedding function on raw data. More commonly, the raw data is unstructured data, though it is also possible to generate vectors from structured data. Structured data consists of clearly defined data types and can be stored in database tables as rows and columns. Unstructured data is neither organized in a predefined manner nor with a predefined data model. Examples include images, videos, and text documents. Thanks to social media and advancements in communication technology, unstructured data is quite common nowadays. Companies are working hard to leverage the hidden potential in the unstructured data available at their disposal. The embedding vectors generated from unstructured data can hold information representing the data. These embedding vectors can be used to find similar images, audio, and video. Due to the size of unstructured datasets, storing, indexing, and searching across large sets of unstructured data is a significant challenge.

Vectorizing the data and storing the vectors is just part of the solution. However, storing and retrieving the vectors efficiently remains a challenge. So why not use existing databases?

It is possible to store the vectors in many existing databases, but storing a large number of vectors and searching across these vectors could cause the database to run into performance issues. This is because the indexing available in regular databases is optimized for structured data and not for vectors. Alternatively, we can use vector search libraries, but handling the storage, developing SDKs, and APIs should be handled by the user. Using custom and tailor-made solutions is an option, but not all businesses have the resources and time to develop such solutions. By using a vector database, we can solve these problems.

So far, we have seen what vectors are, sources of vectors in a vector database, and why we should use a vector database. In the upcoming video, let us look at the components of a vector database. Thank you, and see you again.
