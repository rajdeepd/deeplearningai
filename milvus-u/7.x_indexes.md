Storage taken by 128 dimensional floating point embeddings is 128 * the size of float = 512 bytes. Distance used are Euclidean distance (also referred to as L2) with inner product. ( Inner product is a dot product or scalar product of the vectors .)
Some of the indexes supported are FLAT, IVF_FLAT, IVF_PQmIVF_SQ8, HNSW and SCANN.
Table below describes the details (referred from milvus documentation)
| Supported index | Classification | Scenario |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| FLAT | N/A | - Relatively small dataset <br> - Requires a $100 \%$ recall rate |
| IVF_FLAT | Quantization-based index | - High-speed query <br> - Requires a recall rate as high as <br> possible |
| IVF_SQ8 | Quantization-based index | - High-speed query <br> - Limited memory resources <br> - Accepts minor compromise in <br> recall rate |
| IVF_PQ | Quantization-based index | - Very high-speed query <br> - Limited memory resources <br> - Accepts substantial compromise <br> in recall rate |
| HNSW | Graph-based index | - Very high-speed query <br> - Requires a recall rate as high as <br> possible <br> - Large memory resources |
| SCANN | Quantization-based index | - Very high-speed query <br> - Requires a recall rate as high as <br> possible <br> - Large memory resources |
