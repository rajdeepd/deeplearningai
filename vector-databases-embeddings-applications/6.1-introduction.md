# What is Multilingual Search

In this lesson, you'll explore the flexibility of a multilingual model with a vector database, which 
allows you to load and query data in multiple languages. We'll 
also introduce the concept of retrieval augmented generation and explore how you can implement this multi-step process of retrieval, reasoning and generation in one simple query.

Let us have a quick look at what is multilingual search and then how it works and what's the idea behind it. It's very similar to how semantic search works where we can compare like you know 
dog to a puppy. And then, still be able to find a very similar match. But in case of multilingual search, you can have the same text but in different languages which will also generate very similar embeddings if 
not identical and through that we can use the same methods to search across content in any languages we need. We'll explore this in detail in a code.

## What is RAG?

Let us dive very quickly into what RAG is and how it works. So, basically the idea that it allows us 
to use vector database as an external knowledge, but also it allows us to retrieve relevant information 
and provide it back to the LLN, but also it synergizes with the data that sits within a vector database or another benefit of using RUG is that we can use it in our applications, on our data, without having to retrain or fine-tune our LLMs. And in a way you can think of RUG is like you going and visiting a library. 
So, if somebody asks you a question without any resources, you may just make up something. But if you go to library, you can read a book and then provide a response and that's basically what RAG does with a vector database.

Some key advantages of RAG is it allows you to reduce hallucination, you can also enable your LLMs to 
cite sources, but but also it can solve knowledge-intensive tasks, especially for kind of information that is very rare to find out in the wild. 

Here is  very quick illustration of how a full RAG query works


First, we start with a query to a vector database, 
which obtains all the relevant source objects. Then, 
we can combine these together with a prompt and then 
send it to the LLM, which then will go 
and generate the response that we are interested in. And here's 
a very quick example of a code to perform RAC. You 
can see it's very similar to what we've done in 
the past with the queries, except this time we are adding the part 
with generate. But I'm not gonna spend too much time on it 
because I'd like to do it in code. Let's prepare our JSON print function 
and this time for our demo we'll be 
using an already deployed instance of Weaviate in the cloud, which utilizes Cohere's 
multilingual models.


```python
def json_print(data):
    print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
```


```python
import weaviate, os, json
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

auth_config = weaviate.auth.AuthApiKey(api_key=os.getenv("WEAVIATE_API_KEY"))

client = weaviate.Client(
    url=os.getenv("WEAVIATE_API_URL"),
    auth_client_secret=auth_config,
    additional_headers={
        "X-Cohere-Api-Key": os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY"),
        "X-Cohere-BaseURL": os.getenv("CO_API_URL")
    }
)

client.is_ready() #check if True
```
