## Recreate the example

So, let's see how all of this works in action in our code. So, we are 
going to use exactly same data as in the previous lesson. So, I'm not going to over it too much. Let's just quickly load the data, create a new instance of Weaviate. T


```python
import requests
import json

# Download the data
resp = requests.get('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny.json')
data = json.loads(resp.text)  # Load data

# Parse the JSON and preview it
print(type(data), len(data))

def json_print(data):
    print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
```


```python
import weaviate, os
from weaviate import EmbeddedOptions
import openai

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file
openai.api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']

client = weaviate.Client(
    embedded_options=EmbeddedOptions(),
    additional_headers={
        "X-OpenAI-Api-BaseURL": os.environ['OPENAI_API_BASE'],
        "X-OpenAI-Api-Key": openai.api_key,  # Replace this with your actual key
    }
)
print(f"Client created? {client.is_ready()}")
```

## Queries

### Dense Search

So let's start with a query that you're already familiar with and you use the Weavnir text and then we'll search for concepts on animal. And then, we can see that semantically we can match things like mammals and crocodile and well, exact match on animal itself. 

```python
response = (
    client.query
    .get("Question", ["question", "answer"])
    .with_near_text({"concepts":["animal"]})
    .with_limit(3)
    .do()
)

json_print(response)
```


```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "Question": [
        {
          "answer": "Elephant",
          "question": "It's the only living mammal in the order Proboseidea"
        },
        {
          "answer": "the nose or snout",
          "question": "The gavial looks very much like a crocodile except for this bodily feature"
        },
        {
          "answer": "Antelope",
          "question": "Weighing around a ton, the eland is the largest species of this animal in Africa"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```



### Sparse Search - BM25

Now, let's try to run the same query, but with a keyword search. So, I am going to add with BM 25, and 
our query again is animal. And let's see what kind of results we get. And you see this time we only get one object back, which exactly matches on the animal.

```python
response = (
    client.query
    .get("Question",["question","answer"])
    .with_bm25(query="animal")
    .with_limit(3)
    .do()
)

json_print(response)
```

Output response is given below:


```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "Question": [
        {
          "answer": "Antelope",
          "question": "Weighing around a ton, the eland is the largest species of this animal in Africa"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


### Hybrid Search

<img src="/deeplearningai/vector-databases-embeddings-applications/l5_images/Screenshot_2024-01-27_at_10.25.38â€¯PM.png" width="80%" />

We're getting to the juicy part where we can actually execute the hybrid search. So, let's go with hybrid and our query again is animal and we have this special parameter called alpha which basically tells which one to favor with alpha closer to one means that we are favoring the scores from the vector search from the dense vector search while when alpha is closer to zero then we are favoring keyword search. 

```python
response = (
    client.query
    .get("Question",["question","answer"])
    .with_hybrid(query="animal", alpha=0.5)
    .with_limit(3)
    .do()
)

json_print(response)
```
So, let's run this and then now we can see that we're getting 
very similar results as before. 

```python
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "Question": [
        {
          "answer": "Elephant",
          "question": "It's the only living mammal in the order Proboseidea"
        },
        {
          "answer": "the nose or snout",
          "question": "The gavial looks very much like a crocodile except for this bodily feature"
        },
        {
          "answer": "Antelope",
          "question": "Weighing around a ton, the eland is the largest species of this animal in Africa"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


But the interesting thing is that 
the object that has the keyword animal inside 
is ranked as a top result which brings it up all the 
way to the top into our attention and we could return it 
to our users.

Now, let's grab this again and then try one 
more time but with a different alpha. So, if I set 
this to zero, then we should get only the responses that are 
helpful based on the keyword search. So, none of the vector search were 
returned. And if we try the same thing with alpha, let's say 
one, this will basically be a pure dense vector 
search. And voila, this is the power between the dense and 
sparse vector search and also combining of both 
of them through hybrid search. And in the next 
lesson, we'll dive into multilingual search and also Retrieval 
Augmented Generation.
