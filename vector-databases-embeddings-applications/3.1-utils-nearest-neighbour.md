## Nearest Neighbour Code Listing

This Python code snippet defines a function `nearest_neigbor` that takes two parameters, `vec_pos` and `query_vec`, and performs the following operations:

1. **Initialization**: 
    - `nearest_neighbor_index` is set to -1, to be updated with the index of the nearest neighbor.
    - `nearest_dist` is initialized to infinity, to be updated with the distance of the nearest neighbor.

2. **Graph Construction (Linear Graph)**:
    - The function iterates over the `vec_pos` array (assumed to be a NumPy array).
    - In each iteration, it performs two tasks:
        - Adds a node to a list named `nodes`. Each node represents an index `i` and its position from `vec_pos`.
        - Creates edges between sequential nodes. The last node is connected back to the first node, forming a circular connection.
    - During this process, the function also calculates the Euclidean distance (`dist`) between the `query_vec` and the current node's position. This is done using `np.linalg.norm`.

3. **Finding Nearest Neighbor**:
    - While iterating, the function continuously checks if the current distance (`dist`) is less than `nearest_dist`.
    - If it is, the function updates `nearest_neighbor_index` with the current index `i` and `nearest_dist` with the new distance.

4. **Graph Creation (Nearest Neighbor)**:
    - After the iteration, two graphs are created:
        - `G_lin`: A graph with all nodes and edges added from `nodes` and `edges` lists. This graph represents a linear connection between all nodes.
        - `G_best`: A graph created to highlight the nearest neighbor. It contains only the nearest neighbor node, indicated with a "*".

5. **Return**:
    - The function returns two graphs: `G_lin` and `G_best`.

The purpose of this function seems to be to find the nearest neighbor to a given query vector in a set of vectors (`vec_pos`) and return two graphs: one showing all the vectors and their linear connections, and the other highlighting the nearest neighbor. This code uses the `networkx` library for graph operations, as indicated by the `nx.Graph()` method.

```python
def nearest_neigbor(vec_pos,query_vec):
    nearest_neighbor_index = -1
    nearest_dist = float('inf')

    nodes = []
    edges = []
    for i in range(np.shape(vec_pos)[0]):
        nodes.append((i,{"pos": vec_pos[i,:]}))
        if i<np.shape(vec_pos)[0]-1:
            edges.append((i,i+1))
        else:
            edges.append((i,0))

        dist = np.linalg.norm(query_vec-vec_pos[i])
        if dist < nearest_dist:
            nearest_neighbor_index = i
            nearest_dist = dist
        
    G_lin = nx.Graph()
    G_lin.add_nodes_from(nodes)
    G_lin.add_edges_from(edges)

    nodes = []
    nodes.append(("*",{"pos": vec_pos[nearest_neighbor_index,:]}))
    G_best = nx.Graph()
    G_best.add_nodes_from(nodes)
    return G_lin, G_best

```
