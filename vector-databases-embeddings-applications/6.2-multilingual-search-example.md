## How RAG works for Multilingual Search

Here is  very quick illustration of how a full RAG query works

First, we start with a query to a vector database, which obtains all the relevant source objects. Then, 
we can combine these together with a prompt and then send it to the LLM, which then will go 
and generate the response that we are interested in. And here's a very quick example of a code to perform RAG. You can see it's very similar to what we've done in the past with the queries, except this time we are adding the part with generate. 

But I'm not gonna spend too much time on it because I'd like to do it in code. Let's prepare our JSON print function and this time for our demo we'll be using an already deployed instance of Weaviate in the cloud, which utilizes Cohere's multilingual models.


### 1. Load the Client

```python
def json_print(data):
    print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
```

Create a client which connects to Weaviate and Cohere.

```python
import weaviate, os, json
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

auth_config = weaviate.auth.AuthApiKey(api_key=os.getenv("WEAVIATE_API_KEY"))

client = weaviate.Client(
    url=os.getenv("WEAVIATE_API_URL"),
    auth_client_secret=auth_config,
    additional_headers={
        "X-Cohere-Api-Key": os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY"),
        "X-Cohere-BaseURL": os.getenv("CO_API_URL")
    }
)

client.is_ready() #check if True
```

And in here, you can see that we are providing two types of API keys, a Cohere API key which we use for multilingual search and an OpenAI API key which 
we use for generative search. Let's very quickly see how many objects we are dealing with in our 
database. So, we have about 4.3 million Wikipedia articles to play with which is great. So now, let's have some fun with this big data set and then run some queries. 
 
In this case, what we want to do is search for vacation spots in California. Let's run this query and return five objects. And you can straightaway see that we got few objects that are returned in English.


### 2. How many vectors are stored in this database


```python
print(json.dumps(client.query.aggregate("Wikipedia").with_meta_count().do(), indent=2))
```
    {
    "data": {
        "Aggregate": {
        "Wikipedia": [
            {
            "meta": {
                "count": 4306800
            }
            }
        ]
        }
    }
    }

### 3. Perform search over them to find concepts you are interested in!


```python
response = (client.query
            .get("Wikipedia",['text','title','url','views','lang'])
            .with_near_text({"concepts": "Vacation spots in california"})
            .with_limit(5)
            .do()
           )

json_print(response)
```

    {
    "data": {
        "Get": {
        "Wikipedia": [
            {
            "lang": "en",
            "text": "Many locals and tourists frequent the Southern California coast for its beaches. Some of southern California's most popular beaches are Malibu, Laguna Beach, La Jolla, Manhattan Beach, and Hermosa Beach.

            {
            "lang": "en",
            "text": "Carbon Beach, Surfrider Beach, Westward Beach, Escondido Beach, Paradise Cove, Point Dume, Pirates Cove, Zuma Beach, Trancas and Encinal Bluffs are places along the coast in Malibu.

            "title": "Californie",
            "url": "https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=623",

            {
            "lang": "es",
            "text": "Oeste: Burlingame, Hillcrest, Linda Vista, Midtown, Midway, Mission Hills, Mission Valley West, Morena, North Park, Ocean Beach, Old Town, Pacific Beach, Point Loma (incluyendo a Roseville-Fleetridge, Shelter Island, Sunset Cliffs, La Playa y University Heights).",
            "title": "San Diego (California)",
            "url": "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=117310",
            "views": 1000
            },
            {
            "lang": "es",
            "text": "Entre sus playas m\u00e1s importantes se encuentran Surfrider Beach, Zuma Beach, Malibu State Beach y Topanga State Beach; entre sus parques m\u00e1s cercanos est\u00e1n el Parque estatal del arroyo Malib\u00fa (\"Malibu Creek State Park\"), \u00c1rea recreativa nacional de las monta\u00f1as de Santa M\u00f3nica (\"Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area\") y Cueva Paradise (\"Paradise Cove\"), donde se han rodado muchas pel\u00edculas.",

            "views": 900
            }
        ]
        }
    }
    }

And to make our lives easier, we'll add a so that the next results that we get back, they're all in English, and also, we'll just get three objects back. 



```python
response = (client.query
            .get("Wikipedia",['text','title','url','views','lang'])
            .with_near_text({"concepts": "Vacation spots in california"})
            .with_where({
                "path" : ['lang'],
                "operator" : "Equal",
                "valueString":'en'
            })
            .with_limit(3)
            .do()
           )

json_print(response)
```

```json
 {
    "data": {
        "Get": {
        "Wikipedia": [
            {
            "lang": "en",
            "text": "Many locals and tourists frequent the Southern California coast for its beaches. Some of southern California's most popular beaches are Malibu, Laguna Beach, La Jolla, Manhattan Beach, and Hermosa ....Snow Valley Mountain Resort, and Mountain High. The inland desert city of Palm Springs is also popular.",
            "title": "Southern California",
            "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62520",
            "views": 2000
            },
            {
            "lang": "en",
            "text": "Carbon Beach, ...Los Angeles County, nude sunbathers are subject to fines and/or arrest.",
            "title": "Malibu, California",
            "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=107655",
            "views": 2000
            },
            {
            "lang": "en",
            "text": "The coastlines of Mexico harbor many stretches of beaches that are frequented by ..border is the weekend draw of San Felipe, Baja California.",
            "title": "Mexico",
            "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3966054",
            "views": 3000
            }
        ]
        }
    }
    }
```

But a query is still multilingual, right? So, what else can we do with this? 
How about we try to send a query in a different language? 
 
So, in this case, we are asking for vacation spots in California, 
but in Polish. And if I run this query, we're still getting the same results as we had before. 

```python
response = (client.query
            .get("Wikipedia",['text','title','url','views','lang'])
            .with_near_text({"concepts": "Miejsca na wakacje w Kalifornii"})
            .with_where({
                "path" : ['lang'],
                "operator" : "Equal",
                "valueString":'en'
            })
            .with_limit(3)
            .do()
           )

json_print(response)
```

How about we try something with a completely different alphabet so we can run the same query but in Arabic.

```python
response = (client.query
            .get("Wikipedia",['text','title','url','views','lang'])
            .with_near_text({"concepts": "أماكن العطلات في كاليفورنيا"})
            .with_where({
                "path" : ['lang'],
                "operator" : "Equal",
                "valueString":'en'
            })
            .with_limit(3)
            .do()
           )

json_print(response)
```

And that's the performs really well as soon it returns to objects that talks about vacation spots in 
California. 

Now, let's do some RAG example. So, the starting point is very similar as we had before. It's a straight up 
semantic query and now we can add a prompt. So, let's call it prompt and the text will be 
something like write me a Facebook ad about and I want to grab the title from my query and then so we do it with the curly brackets and then we could say using information inside and then we can provide text and by doing that we basically constructed the prompt based on the results we get from the query and. To exit the actual query, we need to add with generate, and we'll pass in a single prompt, which will take our prompt that we constructed just above. 


```python
prompt = "Write me a facebook ad about {title} using information inside {text}"
result = (
  client.query
  .get("Wikipedia", ["title","text"])
  .with_generate(single_prompt=prompt)
  .with_near_text({
    "concepts": ["Vacation spots in california"]
  })
  .with_limit(3)
).do()

json_print(result)
```

Another type of a RAG query is a group task which basically takes a prompt and then also runs a query and then sends all the results as a single query into GPT and then we can run it and expect only one generation 
and like in this case we want to summarize what these posts are about into paragraphs. And as a result, we get a summary of all the three posts that were returned from the original query. And that concludes this lesson in which you learn how to use multilingual search where you were able to search across content written in any language, but also by providing queries in whatever language you needed. 
We also went over a few examples of rag query, in which we use single prominent group task to be able to 
generate responses based on individual objects or based on collective response. 


```python
generate_prompt = "Summarize what these posts are about in two paragraphs."

result = (
  client.query
  .get("Wikipedia", ["title","text"])
  .with_generate(grouped_task=generate_prompt) # Pass in all objects at once
  .with_near_text({
    "concepts": ["Vacation spots in california"]
  })
  .with_limit(3)
).do()

json_print(result)

```
