# Introduction to Vibe Coding with Replit

## Course Format
This is a video-only course due to Replit's cloud-hosted environment. The course focuses on key concepts of coding agents and LLM code generation. While watching the videos will teach you the core concepts, an optional Replit account is needed for hands-on practice.


## Course Instructors
The course is led by Michele Catasta, President of Replit, and Matt Palmer, Head of Developer Relations.


## Development with AI Coding Agents

### Replit's Key Features
Replit provides a powerful code editor and universal package manager, eliminating the need to struggle with package installations. Source control is powered by Git with seamless integration. The platform offers built-in key-value stores, database solutions, and deployment capabilities, making it possible for anyone without coding experience to create and deploy applications.


### Vibe Coding Approach
The course emphasizes leveraging coding agents for heavy lifting while demonstrating how strategic planning can improve results. Throughout the lessons, you'll learn valuable tips and tricks for getting optimal results from the agent.


## Course Projects

### SEO Analyzer
The first project introduces a basic SEO analyzer application that will help establish key concepts and foundational understanding.


### Head-to-Head Voting App
The second project focuses on building a voting application that demonstrates data extraction implementation and storage solutions. Through this project, you'll learn essential web app building blocks.


## Behind the Scenes
The course provides insights into Replit's architecture and shares valuable lessons learned from building agentic workflows. Michele shares experiences from the past year of development.
