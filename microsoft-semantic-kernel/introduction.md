As LLMs continue to develop, finding ways to efficiently 
incorporate their capabilities into applications for many users 
has become increasingly urgent. 
I'm delighted today to introduce a course with one of the leading global 
application developers, Microsoft, which has been developing an SDK called Semantic Kernel that can enable you to rapidly use 
LLMs in your applications. 


Well, you know, when you think about Symantec Kernel, 
it's kind of a fancy name, but just remember it's an open source toolkit. 

It's the brainchild of Microsoft's deputy CTO. Sam Scalace. Sam is the inventor of something called Google Docs, you may have heard of. 

There's two underlying concepts to this new wave of AI that I think matter the most. I like to tell people to stick their hands out in front of them. 
It's hard when you're on a remote, but stick your hands out in front of you, take your right hand, shake it, and call this the completion engine. 

The completion engine. It can finish my sentence. And then take out your left hand, shake it a bit.  The left hand is a similarity engine. It's like a magnet, it can sort of pull things out and find things that are similar that are something you wouldn't expect a computer program to find as similar at all. 
So the ability to compare meaning is very new, at least it feels to me, to some of you as well. And then this completion engine is the kind of wow. 
We sort of focus on the completion engine. oh my god it's so amazing, but the similarity and you 
need some love. 
So it's this combination of these two that are really making this wave feel different at least when I talk to businesses 
of all sizes and I think for small business as well this combination left hand right hand working together it's 
pretty cool. 
We see this in places like retrieval augmented generation so-called 
RAG the ability to connect context with completion but also if you don't have context and you try to complete something, you end up with hallucinations, because the completion engine is running on an empty stomach. 
So these two together, a combination of two hands, 
is pretty amazing. And in this course, we're going to try to make sure you don't stay sort of playing with your fingers, but actually 
coding with Symantec Kernel. 
You're going to use two AI plugins. Number one, a design thinking plugin, and number two, a business thinking plugin. 

In this course, we're going to combine traditional business thinking with the power of LLMs to help make Andrew's pizza shop owner's business life 
a little better. 
In the process, you're going to learn about open source semantic kernel. 

You're going to start by building some semantic functions to summarize some text and do the regular things like chaining. 
Then we'll jump into design thinking. You're going to take customer feedback and stick it into the plugin and get it to do things and generate the magic of AI. 

We work from top down, we're going to apply SWOT analysis to the pizza 
shop using the business thinking AI plugin to find ways to improve cost and time efficiency. 
So moving on, we're going to play with vector memory, of 
course. Everyone loves that. 
And use our planner module to finish the meal to get you thinking about the future of this AI revolution.
