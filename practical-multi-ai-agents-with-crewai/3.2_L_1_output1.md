3. **Create a Responsive Design:** Jane Doe carries this task because of her direct involvement in user-centric features. It aligns with her skills in delivering functional software that meets design specifications.

4. **Develop the User Interface:** Continuing after the responsive design, Jane Doe remains designated for UI development, capitalizing on her work from the previous task. 

5. **Create Navigation System:** This task runs concurrently with the User Interface development. It’s suitable for Jane Doe to manage since both tasks are interconnected in the design and engineering process.

6. **Develop 'About Us' Page & Subsequent Pages:** Here, due to Jane Doe's ongoing commitment, she continues to develop various content pages, ensuring effective continuity and her deep understanding of project context.

7. **Quality Assurance Testing:** Alice Johnson and Tom Brown are both assigned to QA, equally sharing the workload to ensure thorough testing of the entire website, thus optimizing performance and usability prior to final release.

8. **Final Review and Revisions:** Collaboration at this stage involves all key personnel including John Doe and Jane Doe, along with both QA Engineers, to review and finalize all elements comprehensively, incorporating lessons learned and feedback from previous testing.

9. **Launch Website:** The final task again involves John Doe and Jane Doe to ensure a smooth launch, leveraging their positioned knowledge on project dynamics and technical execution.

### Summary:
This allocation strategy optimally positions team members based on their capabilities and current roles while ensuring workload balance and project timeline adherence. By keeping Jane Doe heavily involved in the development phases while integrating support from Bob and QA Engineers, the project maintains a streamlined workflow. This strategic plan minimizes risks and maximizes productivity, paving the way for a successful project outcome.
