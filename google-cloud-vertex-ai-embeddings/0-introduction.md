Hello and welcome to our concise course titled "Understanding and Applying Text Embeddings with Vertex AI", developed in collaboration with Google Cloud. Throughout this course, you will explore the various characteristics and uses of text embeddings. Together, we will delve into the calculation of embeddings, which are essentially feature vector representations of text sequences of any length, and discover how these sentence embeddings serve as a potent instrument for various tasks including classification, detecting anomalies, and grouping texts. If you're familiar with word embedding algorithms like Word2Vec or GloVe, which focus on individual words, this concept is somewhat similar but significantly more advanced and versatile. It deals with understanding sentences or even paragraphs, capable of handling unseen words in the training dataset.

Additionally, this course will guide you through integrating text generation features of expansive language models with sentence-level embeddings to construct a compact question-answering system. This system will be capable of responding to inquiries about Python, utilizing Stack Overflow posts as its knowledge base. Allow me to introduce Nikita Namjushi, my co-instructor for this course.

Thank you, Andrew. I am thrilled to co-teach this course with you. In my role at Google Cloud AI, I assist developers in leveraging large language models, and I am eager to share the hands-on knowledge I've accumulated from assisting a broad spectrum of cloud clients and numerous large language model applications.

The course is structured into several key topics. In the first segment, which I will lead, we will start by employing an embeddings model to generate and examine various text embeddings. Together, we will gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanics behind these embeddings, how they are crafted for text sequences of any length, and employ coding exercises to visualize their distinct attributes. 


After you've explored the varied aspects of embeddings, you will learn how to apply them in tasks like classification, clustering, and identifying outliers. The depth of sentence-level embeddings enables algorithms to understand the full context of sentences, enhancing their ability to make more informed decisions regarding text analysis. Following this, we will delve into the utilization of text generation models, including an overview of the adjustable parameters. Ultimately, we will combine all the knowledge gained on embeddings, semantic similarity, and text generation to create a compact question-answering system.
